function template:
(1), function template and non-template function can overload at the same file, when there are all fitable for call,
    compiler choose non-template function first
(2), Automatic type conversion only for non-template function
(3), all overload function transform arguement by reference, two cautious: first, if the number of the function arguement is 
   different; second, the arguement's type of the function is different, or it will bring side effect 
(4), function called should be defined before calling

class template:
(1), completily declaration must be added showly before class's function, when you define class's function outside of class
(2), template arguement of class must be added showly, when you use template class 
(3), template class and template class's function instantiated separated, the latter instantiated until
   you use a template class's function  
(4), if a template class has a static data member, it will instantiated with template class
(5), template class specialization like as function overload, specialization class can defined what different from template class
(6), default template arguement
